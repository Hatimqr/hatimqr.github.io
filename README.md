# Personal Track: Character Formation

### "Finding My Foundation" (Pre-2019)

Rowing wasn't just a sport—it was where I discovered who I was. Through grueling daily training sessions, I found real meaning in pushing myself through discomfort. This wasn't about winning medals; it was about understanding that growth lives in the space between comfort and breaking point. Here I met my closest friends and learned what leadership actually meant—not from titles, but from my coach, seniors, and eventually by doing it myself. Rowing taught me that true satisfaction comes from showing up when it's hardest.

### "The Ultimate Test" (2019-2021)

At 17, I lost my mother after her long battle with cancer during most of my teenage years. April 2019 changed everything. When COVID hit, while others saw isolation, I saw an opportunity to prove something to myself. Instead of breaking down, I chose to build up. I threw myself into studying with laser focus, achieving the best A-level results in my batch. This period taught me something crucial: I could compartmentalize unimaginable mental strain without giving in. I learned that adversity doesn't have to diminish performance—it can fuel it.

### "The Courage to Pivot" (2021)

I had always been fascinated by Formula 1—the precision, the technology, the split-second decisions. I applied to engineering programs worldwide, dreaming of working in motorsport. But when acceptance letters came with price tags, I had a moment of brutal honesty: I wasn't absolutely certain this was my path. Rather than settling or forcing it, I made a difficult decision. I chose uncertainty over false certainty and took a gap year to do the thinking I didn't have capacity for during COVID. This taught me that true confidence means admitting when you're wrong and having the courage to change course.

### "Embracing the Unknown" (2022-Present)

At NYU Abu Dhabi, I initially planned to study economics—the logical path to consulting. But the flexibility of a liberal arts education called to me. When economics got waitlisted and I found myself in a computer science schedule, I could have switched. Instead, I saw a challenge. Knowing absolutely nothing about programming, I was intimidated but excited. I flipped the script: prove to myself that I could master a completely foreign subject at degree level, at least for a semester. By midterms, I had decided to become a CS major with an economics minor. Programming clicked because it was pure logic, and my brain is hardwired to think logically.

I set myself an impossible standard: maintain above 3.9 GPA after freshman year. An A- would become unacceptable. This wasn't about proving anything to others—it was about benchmarking myself and proving I could do it. I'm built for challenges that others might avoid.

# Professional Track: Finding Purpose Through Impact

### "First Taste of Real Problems" (July 2021 - Feb 2022)

**KPMG Corporate Finance Intern**

Walking into KPMG during my gap year, I had no idea what corporate finance actually meant. Within weeks, I was thrown into M&A work for microfinance companies, learning DCF modeling, CAPM valuations, and feasibility analysis. The fertilizer plant project was my first real taste of how data-driven analysis translates into million-dollar decisions.

**The moment that clicked:** Presenting investment recommendations to senior management and seeing how rigorous analysis could influence strategic direction. This wasn't academic exercise—this was solving problems that mattered. The dynamic nature of consulting brought back the same sense of purpose I'd found in rowing. I knew this would be my end goal.

**Skills developed:** Financial modeling, valuation methodologies, client presentation skills, strategic thinking

### "The Foundation Years" (Aug 2022 - May 2023)

**NYU Abu Dhabi Computer Science Student**

Starting university with zero programming experience was intimidating, but I treated it as the ultimate challenge. Each algorithm I mastered, each data structure I understood, was proof that I could learn anything if I applied myself. The logical nature of programming clicked with how my brain naturally processes problems.

**The moment that clicked:** Midway through my first semester, realizing that programming wasn't just about syntax—it was about breaking complex problems into logical, solvable components. This was consulting thinking in code form.

### "Discovering the Power of Data" (June 2023 - Aug 2023)

**PwC Data Analyst Intern**

My first real exposure to how data drives business decisions. Working with timesheet data and visualization tools, I saw how analytics could uncover productivity patterns that weren't visible to management. This was where I first initiated research into AI tools for decision-making, exploring frameworks like Delphi.

**The moment that clicked:** Creating a dashboard that revealed productivity bottlenecks across departments. Watching managers have "aha moments" when data made the invisible visible. This was the power of translation—turning numbers into narratives that drive action.

**Skills developed:** Data visualization (Tableau), business intelligence, statistical analysis, productivity optimization strategies

### **Initiative Moment: CareSync Medical Platform**

Inspired by seeing how data could solve real business problems, I decided to build something from scratch. Led a team to create an end-to-end appointment management system for small medical clinics. This wasn't just about coding—it was about understanding user needs, designing systems, and delivering solutions that work in the real world.
